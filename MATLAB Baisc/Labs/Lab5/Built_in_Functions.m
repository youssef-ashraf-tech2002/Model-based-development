% Task 7: Using Built-in Functions

% Use MATLAB's built-in functions like max, min, and sum in a script.
% Create a vector of numbers and apply these functions to it.
% Submission: Prepare a MATLAB script that includes your solutions to the tasks above. Save the script as a .m file and submit it. Be sure to include comments to explain your code.

x= [1 2 3 4 5];      %vector of numbers
Max = max(x)         %Max  of numbers    
Min = min(x)         %Min  of numbers  
Sum = sum(x)         %Sum  of numbers
